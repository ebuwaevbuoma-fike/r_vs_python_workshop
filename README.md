# Workshop: R vs Python for Data Analysis

This repository contains materials for a workshop comparing and contrasting the use of R and Python for data analysis. 

**Workshop Objectives:**

* Gain a foundational understanding of Python for data analysis.
* Explore key Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
* Compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of R and Python for different data analysis tasks.
* Develop practical skills in using Python for data analysis.
* Bonus content: Build and navigate a local Python environment for your projects.

**Contents:**

* **Python Environment:**
    * `rpy2_workshop.yml`: A conda environment file for setting up the necessary Python packages.
* **Workshop Materials:**
    * Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts with code examples and exercises.
    * Data files used in the workshop.
    * Other relevant resources (e.g., documentation, tutorials).

**Getting Started :**
Follow the steps under the "Installations and Setup for Google Colab" section of the notebook.

**Data Source**

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 10,000 bikes and 600 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City. This dataset includes Citi Bike trips since Citi Bike launched in September 2013 and is updated daily. The data has been processed by Citi Bike to remove trips that are taken by staff to service and inspect the system, as well as any trips below 60 seconds in length, which are considered false starts.

This public dataset is hosted in Google BigQuery and is included in BigQuery's 1TB/mo of free tier processing. This means that each user receives 1TB of free BigQuery processing every month, which can be used to run queries on this public dataset. Watch this short video to learn how to get started quickly using BigQuery to access public datasets.Â [What is BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction)
